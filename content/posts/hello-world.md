description: A first post to test things out.

This is my first post. A place to write about things I'm learning, building, and thinking about.

## Why write?

Writing helps clarify thinking. When you have to explain something, you discover the gaps in your understanding.

## What to expect

I'll share thoughts on:

- Building products
- Design and development
- Things I find interesting

Nothing too formal. Just a place to put ideas.

## Code example

Here's a simple function in TypeScript:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Using the function
const message = greet("World");
console.log(message);
```

And some inline code like `const x = 42` works too.

## Images

You can include images in posts. They'll be styled with rounded corners and a subtle shadow.
